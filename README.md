# While

Generic reducer construct for iterating over arbitrary data structures.

This is useful for iterating over non-enumerable data without defining recursive functions manually, and allowing you to capture data at the call side by creating a closure.

## Parser Example

```elixir
import While

# ðŸ‘‡ A: non-enumerable data
parser = %Parser{}

parser = 
  #     ðŸ‘‡ B: condition           ðŸ‘‡ C: data being iterated over 
  while another_token?(parser) <- parser do
    # D: returns a Parser struct that has consumed the next token
    # value is passed to the next iteration
    Parser.next_token(parser)
  end
```

## Counter Example

```elixir
  counter = 0

  while counter < 10 <- counter do
    counter + 1
  end
```

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `while` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:while, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
